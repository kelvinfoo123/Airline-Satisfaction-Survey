The top 3 factors that airline passengers are most dissatisfied with are seat comfort, food and inflight wifi.Since inflight wifi and food cost lesser and require a shorter timespan to improve on, the airline company can work on improving these two factors first while seat comfort can be improved over a longer timespan.
The airline company can consider giving passengers a survey to find out the type of food they like in order to improve the satisfaction level of the food.
